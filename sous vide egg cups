12 eggs
1 cup of heavy cream
blend in a container

fill each canning jar about 1/3rd full with toppings of your choice
  gruyere cheese and bacon make excellent choices
  anything you'd normally use to make an omelette would work well
add egg mixture to jar and seal lightly

set sous vide to 170Â°F
place cups in the water bath for 90 minutes
if using twist top jars, seal completely after cooking

to eat
invert on a small plate to remove from the jar
reheat in the microwave for about 1 minute on "high"
